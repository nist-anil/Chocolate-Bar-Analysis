# Chocolate-Bar-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis on the Chocolate Bar Ratings dataset provided on Kaggle by Rachael Tatman

# Introduction
Chocolate is one of the most popular candies in the world. Each year, residents of the United States collectively eat more than 2.8 billions pounds. However, not all chocolate bars are created equal! This dataset contains expert ratings of over 1,700 individual chocolate bars, along with information on their regional origin, percentage of cocoa, the variety of chocolate bean used and where the beans were grown. This dataset was provided by [kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/chocolate-bar-ratings)

# Acknowledgements
These ratings were compiled by Brady Brelinski, Founding Member of the Manhattan Chocolate Society. For up-to-date information, as well as additional content (including interviews with craft chocolate makers), please see his website: Flavors of Cacao

# Inspiration
* Where are the best cocoa beans grown?
* Which countries produce the highest-rated bars?
* Whatâ€™s the relationship between cocoa solids percentage and rating?

# Key Findings
## The key findings from the detailed analysis are mentioned below:
*  The best cocoa beans grown in Venezuela.
*  Venezuela produces highest rated chocolate bars.
*  No evident correlation found between cocoa solids percentage and rating. A numerical correlation gives a weak negative correlation coefficient of -0.16
